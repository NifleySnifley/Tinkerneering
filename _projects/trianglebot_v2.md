I'm planning on implementing the control system with a Raspberry Pi 5 and ROS2, similar to how I set up the weed-spraying rover, but I've been busy with so many things - This project has certainly been put on the backburner.

The drive gearboxes (custom, 3D printed) use the same DENSO throttle motor as the last iteration, but with a much better designed (if I should say so myself :P) and higher reduction gearbox. From my limited testing "driving" it with a RC receiver, it's much more controllable at low speeds and more precisely maneuverable.

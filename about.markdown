Hi! I'm Finn.  
As you can probably see from my posts, I have many hobbies and I'm interested in many different disciplines and areas of technology and engineering, here are some specifics:

- Robotics (control systems, mechanics, etc.)
- Computer Engineering (FPGA design, computer architecture)
- Embedded Systems (IOT devices, PCB design, firmware and support software, real-time systems)
- Computer Science (DSA, networking, systems programming)
- Competitive Programming (AdventOfCode, Codewars, local competitions)

## Skills

- **Programming**
  - Adept in C/C++, Python, and Rust, quick to learn new languages and environments, familiar with JavaScript, Java, C#, Nim and Verilog HDL
  - Worked on many small and large projects including web development for a local club, systems programming, embedded programming, automation, and general scripting
- **Working in teams**
  - Planned and orchestrated the integration of hardware, software, and electronics within a FRC team with tight deadlines.
  - Cooperated with a small team on software and physical designs using collaborative CAD, development software, and virtual discussions during COVID for the FIRST Innovation challenge.
- **Self-learning**
  - Learned about the theory of FPGA design through available academic resources and papers and demonstrated practical skills through self-guided mini-projects involving FPGAs.
  - Gained experience in tooling and design software for creating PCBs (KiCAD) and creating the associated firmware (ESP-IDF/PlatformIO) for an embedded system.
- **Problem solving**
  - Designed hardware and software solutions for embedded sensing and integration with existing systems using low-cost hardware despite of limited resources and regulations.
  - Participated in multiple local and global computer science competitions including the Advent of Code. During this competition I placed second, then first in two years of local competition, and placed in the sought-after top-100 two days for the Advent of Code 2022.

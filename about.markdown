Hi! I'm Finn.  
As you can probably see from my posts, I'm interested in many different engineering disciplines and topics, here are some specifics:

- Robotics (control systems, mechanics, etc.)
- Computer Engineering (FPGA design, computer architecture)
- Embedded Systems (IOT devices, PCB design, firmware and support software, real-time systems)
- Computer Science (DSA, networking, systems programming)
- Competitive Programming (AdventOfCode, Codewars, local competitions)

## Skills

- **Programming**
  - Adept in C/C++, Python, and Rust, quick to learn new languages and environments, familiar with JavaScript, Java, C#, Nim and Verilog HDL
  - Worked on many small and large projects including web development for a local club, systems programming, embedded programming, automation, and general scripting
- **Working in teams**
  - Planned and orchestrated the integration of hardware, software, and electronics within an FRC team with tight deadlines.
  - Cooperated with a small team on software and physical designs using collaborative CAD, development software, and virtual discussions during COVID for the FIRST Innovation challenge.
  - Led a small team of robotics students to build a swerve drive robot on our own time outside of robotics.
- **Relentless self-learning**
  - Learned about the theory of FPGA design through available academic resources and papers and demonstrated practical skills through self-guided mini-projects involving FPGAs.
  - Gained experience in tooling and design software for creating PCBs (KiCAD) and creating the associated firmware (ESP-IDF/PlatformIO) for an embedded system.
  - Studied for and passed the technician class HAM radio exam
- **Problem solving**
  - Designed hardware and software solutions for embedded sensing and integration with existing systems using low-cost hardware despite limited resources and regulations.
  - Participated in multiple local and global computer science competitions including the Advent of Code. In 2021 I placed 2nd in our local Advent of Code competition. In 2022, I improved to 1st place as well as 2 finishes in the global top 100. In 2023, I improved yet again, placing 1st locally and somehow managed to get on the global leaderboard 5 times!

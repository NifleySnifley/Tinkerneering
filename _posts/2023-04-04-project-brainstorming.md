title:  "Brainstorming Project Ideas"
---

Over the past few days I've been trying to reconcile all of my project ideas - especially those involving robotics - and distill them down to a few, actionable project plans. Some of the ideas I've had include making something like a larger version of the [eduMIP](https://www.ucsdrobotics.org/edumip), building a [Kiwi drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_drive) platform, building a robot arm like a small diy version of KUKA's [KR 700 PA](https://www.kuka.com/en-ca/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots/kr-700-pa)... and the list goes on... I am an endless stream of ideas.

### The hard part: making up my mind

I know that all of these ideas would be really fun to do and that I would certainly learn a lot in the process, but there are a few issues... First of all, obviously, I need to be able to take the project to completion both resources-wise and time-management-wise. Secondly, something I miss all to often when coming up with project ideas: practicality, for me at least, I don't really have any use for a segway robot - do you? I doubt it. With this in mind, I put together a few requirements for a project:

- Mostly consist of parts I already have (motors, electronics, etc.)

- Involve some aspects of control systems engineering, simulation, math, etc.

- Allow for the exploration of autonomous robotics, sensing, etc.

- Practice interdisciplinary engineering skills, mechanical, electrical, etc.

- Able to be completed in a reasonable timeframe (summer break)

After acknowledging these criteria, I think one of these ideas - the TriangleBot kiwi drive robot - is the most viable and doable. My reasoning for this is twofold: First of all, and prolblably most importantly, I have most if not all of the materials on hand to build a robot of this sort. Secondly, I think its the best platform for exploring autonomy and sensing since it's a stable and easily controlled platform.

### Project Management

I know I'm great at procrastinating things (including this blog post...) but since I'm going to be documenting this project on this blog, its probably a good idea to adhere to some sort of plan. 

#### Project Stages:

- Gearbox & drivetrain design

- Frame & Superstructure (electronics panels)

- Manipulator (4+ axis arm)

- Control systems (simulation, modelling, teleoperation)

- Autonomy and sensing (path driving, computer vision, etc.)

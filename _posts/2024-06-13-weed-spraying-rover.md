I had some friends come visit for 5 days over the summer, and we decided that it would be fun see if we could build a functional rover/robot in this short time period. With a couple nights worth of planning ahead of time, [$60 of lawnmower wheels from Menards](https://www.menards.com/main/outdoors/outdoor-power-equipment/outdoor-power-equipment-parts/lawn-mower-parts/brute-reg-8-x-2-lawn-mower-drive-wheel/7103500yp/p-1444438813271-c-1525269720179.htm?exp=false), and a *bunch* of spare old parts from robotics, we managed to build a fully functional weed-eradication robot.

I'll post more details soon, but for now, you can check it out [on the project page](/projects/weed_robot).

Thanks for reading!

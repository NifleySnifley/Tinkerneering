If you are wondering why I haven't added anything to this blog yet in 2024, I have one answer: FIRST Robotics Competition!
For the past ~4 months, I've been spending most if not all of my time outside of school working on [my FRC robotics team's](https://frcteam2530.org/) robot for the 2024 season. I lead the mechanical design and CAD for the robot, but I also helped out with electronics and software integration. This year was the best season our team has ever had, at our first regional we ranked 3rd and were picked by the #1 alliance, but unfortunately we were eliminated in the playoffs. Our second regional was a resounding success - we ranked #1 and won the regional, sending us to the world championship in Houston, TX. At the Championship, we ranked 10th out of the 72 teams in our division (Curie) but were eliminated after just 3 matches in the playoffs. Now, at the end of the season, we ranked in the top 5% of all FRC teams!!! My team still is yet to attend the Minnesota state (MSHSL) tournament which is next weekend but for the most part, our competition season is over and I'm excited to get back to working on my other projects.

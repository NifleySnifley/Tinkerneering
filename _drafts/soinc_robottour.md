# Science Olympiad: *Robot Tour*

As a part of my high school's Science Olympiad team, I'm usually assigned to the building challenges. This year, I was put in a leadership position overseeing the multitude of building challenges our team has to complete, but that doesn't mean I won't get to do any building! Having *Robot Tour* as one of the building events this year really excited me - obviously - I love robots, and one of the few things better than simply building a robot is building a robot *for a good reason*.



### Initial Ideas:

The constraints for the robot in this event are suprisingly lax in my opinion - at least coming from FRC. Some of the basic constrains are as follows:

- Robot must fit in 30x30x30cm bounding box

- Maximum of 6 AA or AAA batteries as a power source

- Must be completely autonomous (no teleop, etc)

- Teams are allowed 5 minutes to reprogram the robot **after seeing the field setup**!

- Sensors are allowed, of course

-  Robot must be started with a #2 pencil
